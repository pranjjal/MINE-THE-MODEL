# Mine The Model

A small project containing a Jupyter notebook with experiments and notes for "Mine The Model".

**Contents**
- `mine-the-model.ipynb` — primary notebook with the project's code and analysis.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+ and Jupyter (or JupyterLab).
- Recommended: create and use a virtual environment.

**Setup**
1. Clone the repo:

   git clone <your-repo-url>
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies (if you have a `requirements.txt`):

   pip install -r requirements.txt

If there is no `requirements.txt`, open the notebook and install packages shown in the first cells.

**Usage**
1. Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

   jupyter lab

2. Open `mine-the-model.ipynb` and run the cells.

**Committing & Pushing to GitHub**
1. Initialize a repo (if not already):

   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: add project notebook and README"
2. Add GitHub remote and push:

   git remote add origin <git-remote-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

**License**
This repository does not include a license file by default. Add a `LICENSE` if you want to specify reuse terms (e.g., MIT).

**Contact / Notes**
- If you'd like, I can add a `requirements.txt` generated from the notebook or expand this README with more details.
